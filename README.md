# Client-Server Architecture and API Design  

## Features  

### 1. Client-Server Architecture  
- **Separation of Concerns**:  
  The client is responsible for the user interface and experience, while the server handles data and business logic.  
- **Scalability**:  
  Scalable architecture enabling distributed deployment of clients and servers.

### 2. REST API Design  
- **URL Structure**:  
  Use clear, descriptive, and resource-based URLs.  
  Example:  

- **Statelessness**:  
Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process it.  

- **Idempotency**:  
- **GET, PUT, DELETE**: Should produce the same result regardless of the number of times the operation is performed.  
- **POST**: Not idempotent; creates new resources.

### 3. Caching and Optimizing API Calls  
- **Caching**:  
- Use HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, and `Expires` to enable caching.  
- Example:  
  ```http  
  Cache-Control: max-age=3600  
  ETag: "unique-resource-identifier"  
  ```  

- **Optimizations**:  
- Implement pagination for large data sets.  
  Example: `GET /api/users?page=1&limit=10`  
- Use data compression (e.g., Gzip) to reduce response sizes.  
- Optimize database queries to prevent over-fetching data.

### 4. Load Balancing and Scalability  
- **Load Balancing**:  
- Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.  
- Tools: Nginx, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.  

- **Scalability**:  
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adding resources (CPU, memory) to a single server.  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to distribute the load.  
- Use clustering and distributed databases to handle increased traffic and data loads.
